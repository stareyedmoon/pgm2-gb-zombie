Map tiles:
    0 - Empty                       Always pure black
    1 - Wall
    2 - Wall decoration             Example: Window
    3 - Edge
    4 - 
    5 - 
    6 - 
    7 - 
    8 - 
    9 - Stairs
    A - Path
    B - Ground                      Example: Grass
    C - 
    D - 
    E - Door
    F - Level transition

    Tiles 0-3 are collidable
    Tiles E-F are transitions
    These are likely to be reorganized in the future, and some of them will probably have their names changed.


    These get converted into various tiles depending on the surrounding tiles and the map type (such as interiors and exteriors)

    Level transition tiles (F) get the texture of their non-collidable neighbor (neighbors are checked in this order: Left, Up, Right, Down)

    TODO - Figure out how transition-type tiles should specify the destination
    TODO - Add something for trees and such
